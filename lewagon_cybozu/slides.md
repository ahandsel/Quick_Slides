Why Cybozu?  

I joined Cybozu because I felt it was ideal to pursue my dream to become an engineer who stands in the middle of designers and front-end developers. Still to this day, not a lot of companies, especially in Japan, don't have this role, and to take a challenge on creating one, I chose the company that the interviewers were most encouraging on this topic.
